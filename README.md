# desuNES
A WIP NES emulator in C, my main goal was for it to be fast, and as a consequence the code is a bit messy and contained in a single structure practically. I have plans to redo the entire program layout but for now i am focusing on learning webDev.

Background and sprites are almost finished, basic controls are also implemented: Arrows and ZXCV keys.


# Mappers implemented at the moment:
  UxROM
  NROM
  MMC1
  MMC3
